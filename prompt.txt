- **Objective**: Analyze the attached PDF document, which contains a series of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), their corresponding options, and complete solutions. Your task is to extract all questions and convert them into a single JSON array object, strictly adhering to the specified schema and formatting rules.
- **Critical Extraction and Formatting InstructionsStrict LaTeX Conversion:** All mathematical expressions, scientific formulas, dimensional analysis (e.g., $\text{[MLT}^{-1}\text{]}$, $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$), Greek letters, and any numerical or symbolic equations MUST be written using LaTeX format enclosed in dollar signs (e.g., $\text{kg/m}^3$ becomes $\text{kg}/\text{m}^3$) inside the string fields (question_latex, options, answer, solution).Plain Text vs. LaTeX:Use the question field for the simple, plain-text version of the question.Use the question_latex field for the key equation or principle of the question in LaTeX format.Diagram Handling (image_url):If a question relies on a diagram, graph, or figure (e.g., a circuit diagram, a graph of displacement vs. time, a ray diagram), provide a specific, descriptive tag in this field.`

- **Required JSON Schema**
  The final output MUST be a JSON array of objects, with each object strictly following this structure:

| Key            | Data Type        | Description                                                   | Formatting Notes                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| id             | Integer          | A unique, sequential identifier for the question.             |                                                  |
| chapter        | String           | The relevant chapter/topic name.                              | (e.g., "Gravitation")                            |
| question       | String           | The question text in plain English.                           |                                                  |
| question_latex | String           | The key formula/equation/concept from the question, in LaTeX. | Use $\text{\$}$ delimiters.                      |
| image_url      | String           | Descriptive tag for diagrams, or "" if none.                  |                                                  |
| options        | Array of Strings | All multiple-choice options.                                  | Use LaTeX for mathematical content.              |
| answer         | String           | The single correct option.                                    | Must match the corresponding entry in options.   |
| solution       | String           | The complete, step-by-step solution from the PDF.             | Crucially, use LaTeX for all mathematical steps. |
| difficulty     | String           | Assigned level: 'easy', 'medium', or 'hard'.                  |                                                  |
| marks          | Integer          | Fixed value of $\mathbf{4}$.                                  |                                                  |

- **Example Output Format** (Including the $\mathbf{solution}$ key)The final output will strictly adhere to the following JSON structure:
